# GoogleTranslate
This project google translates a csv file asynchronously via the web API for localization testing.

It nicely handles basic {token} replacements for existing projects like NGUI. Because it was written in C# and Unity, it's easy to integrate with your existing Unity games, so you can customize it for whatever you might need.

How to Use
------
1. Download and open the project (Unity 5.4.1).
2. View the custom editor window by selecting: Tools -> Google Translate.
3. Drag & drop a TextAsset (CSV) into the public field, specify the desired language and hit Start Translation.
4. View the Console window to monitor the progress.
